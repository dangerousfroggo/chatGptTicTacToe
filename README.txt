DESCRIPTION
this groundbreaking java program allows a user to engage in an exciting game of tic tac toe. users will be given the option to either play against the latest, state-of-the-art trained ai, or play against another human player on the same device.

TECHNOLOGIES USED
this program makes use of the openai API, specifically the text davinci 3.0 model. While not the latest model, it is intelligent enough to play tic tac toe. The program can be easily update to a later model. To parse the response from the API, the JSON.simple library is used.

HOW TO RUN
1) download project
2) import into any coding IDE, or fork the repl and run it (much easier that way)
3) choose IDE type (originally written for replit, some IDEs will have issues with the clearScreen method)
4) insert your openai API key in the environment file (if using replit, use secrets feature. it does the same thing)
5) run the program and follow instructions
